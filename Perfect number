Program to check whether a given number is a perfect number or not is discussed here. A perfect number is a number which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.

For example, 6 is a perfect number.

The divisors of 6 are 1, 2 and 3.

1 + 2 + 3 = 6.


n=int(input())
sum=0
for i in range(1,n):
    if(n%i==0):
        sum+=i
if(sum==n):
    print("Perfect number")
else:
    print("Not a perfect number")
